muse_grs_spectrum - from Braude et al. 2020. Spectrum of GRS taken in 2018 from VLT/MUSE

vims_grs_carlson2016 - from Carlson et al. 2016. Spectrum of GRS as measured by Cassini/VIMS in 2000

*note: these two GRS spectra were included because as the GRS has been changing, the blue part of the two spectra (<600 nm) is a good envelope for the possible range of change in reddish features. But don't take it as ground truth since other features are different than the GRS. I think in the proposal the intention was also to give the reviewers a feature to look at that they're likely familiar with
