# JunoCam Calibration Utils

Set of tools to support the photometric calibration of JunoCam observations.
We provide several modules for handling data before and after training the image-to-image translation model. Details on how to use each module are provided within the module.
In summary:
- **Create dataset:** Generate an unpaired JunoCam/HST segment dataset from flattened maps for training the image-to-image translation model.
- **Evaluation:** Provide metrics to evaluate the quality of the calibrated images such as distribution similarity (FID), spectrum and histogram comparisons, and perceptual metrics such as DreamSim and LPIPS.
- **Mosaic:** Create mosaics (flattened maps) of Jupiter using the calibrated images.
- **Postprocess**: Produce PDS compliant data products for archiving.

## Dependencies
The dependencies can be installed using `pip` or `uv`:
```bash
uv sync
```

There are optional dependencies for each component (`dataset` for creating the database, `eval` for the evaluation scripts, and `export` for the mosaic and post-processing scripts). 
You can install specific components using:
```bash
uv sync --extra [ dataset | eval | export ]
```
or all of them using:
```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

Similarly for `pip`:
```bash
python3 -m pip install ".[ dataset | eval | export ]"
```
